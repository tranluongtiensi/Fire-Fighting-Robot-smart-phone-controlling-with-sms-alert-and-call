# About project
 A fire fighting robot based on Arduino is a robotic device designed to detect and extinguish fires in a safe and effective manner. This type of robot is equipped with sensors  that enable it to navigate around an environment, identify potential fire hazards, and respond quickly to any fire outbreaks. The Arduino microcontroller is the brain of the robot, which provides a platform for controlling the robot's movements and responses.
